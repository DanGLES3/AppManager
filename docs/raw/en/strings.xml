    <string name="intro$main$intro">App Manager is an advanced package manager for Android. It offers countless features, and consequently, requires a user\nmanual to assist its users. This document acts as a user manual for App Manager in the sense that it aims to describe\nevery feature that App Manager has to offer. This document can also be considered as the ``official\'\' guidelines for\nApp Manager, and represents the expected behaviour of App Manager. Translations can misinterpret this document (which is\nwritten in English). Therefore, every capable user should read the English version of the document to get the best out\nof App Manager. There might as well be other unofficial or third-party resources such as blog articles, videos, chat\ngroups, etc. While these resources might be useful for many people, they might not be up-to-date with the current\nversion of App Manager. If any deviations are detected in App Manager from this document, they should be reported in the\n\\href{https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/AppManager/issues}{App Manager issue tracker}.</string>
    <string name="intro$main$terminologies">\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{AM} --- Short name for App Manager.\n    \\item \\textbf{Block/Unblock} --- Used for component blocking or unblocking. How components are blocked depends on\n    the user preferences.\n    \\item \\textbf{IFW} --- Short form of Intent Firewall.\n    \\item \\textbf{Ops} --- Short name for operations, e.g.\\ app ops, batch ops, 1-click ops\n    \\item \\textbf{SSAID} --- Short form of \\texttt{Settings.Secure.ANDROID\\_ID}. It is a device identifier assigned to\n    each app (Android Oreo and onwards). It is generated from the combination of the signing certificate of the app\n    and the SSAID set for the package \\texttt{android}. As a result, it is guaranteed to be the same for an app unless\n    the user choose to format the device. It is widely used for tracking.\n    \\item \\textbf{Tracker} --- Denotes tracker components throughout the document and in App Manager except in the\n    \\hyperref[sec:scanner-page]{scanner page}. Trackers include libraries such as crash reporters, analytics,\n    profiling, identification, ad, location, etc. Thus, they are not equal in functions. There is no distinction or bias\n    between open source and closed source libraries that promote tracking.\n\\end{itemize}</string>
    <string name="intro$main$supported-versions">At present, the supported versions are v2.6.0 (stable), v3.0.0 (alpha and debug releases). Previous versions of App\nManager may contain security vulnerabilities and should not be used.</string>
    <string name="intro$main$bin-sources">App Manager is distributed using the following sources. Unofficial sources may distribute modified versions of App\nManager, and none but you shall be responsible for the consequences of using such distributions.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Official F-Droid repository.\\footnote{For distributing normal releases only}\\\\\n    \\textit{Link:} \\url{https://f-droid.org/packages/io.github.muntashirakon.AppManager}\n    \\item GitHub repository.\\\\\n    \\textit{Normal releases:} \\url{https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/AppManager/releases}\\\\\n    \\textit{Debug releases:} \\url{https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/AppManager/actions}\n    \\item Telegram.\\\\\n    \\textit{Normal releases:} \\url{https://t.me/AppManagerChannel}\\\\\n    \\textit{Debug releases:} \\url{https://t.me/AppManagerDebug}\n\\end{enumerate}</string>
    <string name="intro$main$source-code-links">All but GitHub are the mirror links. The tags should always be up-to-date, but the master branch is not guaranteed to be\nup-to-date. If the target is to clone the master branch, use the GitHub link instead of the others.</string>
    <string name="intro$main$translations">App Manager does not accept translations directly via pull/merge requests. Translations are managed automatically via\nWeblate. To join the translation team, visit \\url{https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/app-manager/}.</string>
    <string name="intro$main$contributing">There are multiple ways a user can contribute, such as creating helpful issues, attending discussions, improving\ndocumentations and translations, adding unrecognised libraries or trackers, reviewing the source code as well as\nreporting security vulnerabilities.</string>
    <string name="intro$main$buiding">Build instructions are available in the BUILDING file located at the root directory of the source.</string>
    <string name="intro$main$submit-patches">Repositories located in sites other than GitHub are currently considered mirrors, and pull/merge requests submitted in\nthose sites will not be accepted.\\footnote{GitHub pull requests will be merged manually using the corresponding patches.\nAs a result, GitHub may wrongfully mark them closed instead of merged.} Instead, patches (as \\texttt{.patch} files) can\nbe submitted via email attachments. \\textit{Signing-off is a requirement.} See the CONTRIBUTING file located at the root\ndirectory of the source for more information.\n\n\\begin{warning}{Notice}\n    In case of submitting patches via email, the whole conversation may be publicly accessible in the future.

    <string name="pages$main-page$intro">Main page lists all the installed, uninstalled and backed up applications. A single click on any installed app item\nopens the respective \\hyperref[sec:app-details-page]{App Details page}. For the uninstalled system apps, it displays a\ndialog prompt which can be used to reinstall the app. Using the \\hyperlink{par:main-page-sort}{sort} option from the\nlist options, the app items can be sorted in various ways and preserved on exit. It is also possible to filter items\nusing the \\hyperlink{par:main-page-filter}{filter} option in the list options. Filtering is possible also via the search\nbar with additional support for the regular expressions.</string>
    <string name="pages$main-page$batch-operations">Batch operations or operation on multiple applications are also available within this page. Multiple selection mode can\nbe activated by clicking on any app icon or by long-clicking on any items in the list. Once activated, a single click on\na list item selects it instead of opening the App Details page. In this mode, the batch operations are located in the\nmultiple selection menu at the bottom of the page.

    <string name="pages$main-page$options-menu">Options menu offers several options that can be used to sort and filter the listed applications as well as to navigate\nto different pages within or outside App Manager.</string>
    <string name="pages$main-page$instructions">Clicking on the \\textbf{Instructions} opens the offline version of the App Manager user manual. It may also open the\nonline version if the corresponding feature split i.e.\\ \\texttt{feat\\_docs} is not installed, or if an WebView is not\npresent in the system to load the manual.</string>
    <string name="pages$main-page$list-options">\\textbf{List options} contain the options to sort and filter the list in the main page.</string>
    <string name="pages$main-page$sort">The applications listed in the main page can be sorted in the following ways:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{User apps first.} The user applications are listed on the top\n    \\item \\textbf{App label.} Sort the list in ascending order based on their application labels (also known as\n    \\textit{application names}). This is the default sorting preference\n    \\item \\textbf{Package name.} Sort the list in ascending order based on their package names\n    \\item \\textbf{Last update.} Sort the list in descending order based on the date they were last updated\n    \\item \\textbf{Shared user ID.} Sort the list in descending order based on their kernel user ID\n    \\item \\textbf{Target SDK.} Sort the list in ascending order based on their target SDK\n    \\item \\textbf{Signature.} Sort the list in ascending order based on their signing information\n    \\item \\textbf{Disabled first.} The disabled applications are listed on the top\n    \\item \\textbf{Blocked first.} Sort the list in descending order based on the number of blocked components each\n    application has\n    \\item \\textbf{Backed up first.} Display the applications with backups on the top\n    \\item \\textbf{Trackers.} Sort the list in descending order based on the number of tracker components each\n    application has\n    \\item \\textbf{Last actions.} Sort the list in descending order based on the latest time and date of any actions made\n    to the applications within App Manager.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIn addition, there is the \\textit{reverse} option that can be used to sort the list in the reverse order. Regardless of\nthe sorting preferences, the applications are sorted alphabetically at first in order to prevent producing any random\nsorting results.</string>
    <string name="pages$main-page$filter">The applications listed in the main page can be filtered in the following ways:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{User apps.} List only the user applications\n    \\item \\textbf{System apps.} List only the system applications\n    \\item \\textbf{Disabled apps.} List only the disabled applications\n    \\item \\textbf{Apps with rules.} List the applications with one or more blocking rules\n    \\item \\textbf{Apps with activities.} List the applications with one or more activities\n    \\item \\textbf{Apps with backups.} List the applications with one or more backups\n    \\item \\textbf{Running apps.} List the applications that are currently running\n    \\item \\textbf{Apps with splits.} List the applications with one or more split APK files\n    \\item \\textbf{Installed apps.} List only the installed applications\n    \\item \\textbf{Uninstalled apps.} List only the uninstalled applications\n    \\item \\textbf{Apps without backups.} List the applications with no backups present.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nUnlike sorting, it is possible to apply more than one filtering options at the same time. For example, the disabled user\napplications can be listed by selecting both \\textit{User apps} and \\textit{Disabled apps}. This can be particularly\nuseful for \\hyperref[subsec:batch-operations]{batch operations} where filtering the user applications may be necessary\nto carry out certain operations safely.</string>
    <string name="pages$main-page$profile_name">It is also possible to list the applications that are only present in a \\hyperref[sec:profiles-page]{profile}. This can\nbe useful for carrying out certain operations on a profile (e.g., uninstalling all the applications in a profile) that\ncannot be done via the \\hyperref[sec:profiles-page]{Profiles page}.</string>
    <string name="pages$main-page$1-click-ops">\\textbf{1-Click Ops} stands for the single-click operations. It opens the \\hyperref[sec:1-click-ops-page]{corresponding\npage} in a new activity.</string>
    <string name="pages$main-page$app-usage">App usage statistics such as \\textit{screen time}, \\textit{data usage} (both mobile and Wi-Fi), \\textit{the number of\ntimes an app was opened} can be accessed by clicking on the \\textbf{App Usage} option in the menu. However, it requires\nthe \\textit{Usage Access} permission. This menu item will not be listed if the usage access feature is disabled in\n\\hyperref[subsec:enable/disable-features]{settings}.</string>
    <string name="pages$main-page$system-config">This menu item opens a new page where various system configurations, blacklists/whitelists included in Android by the\nOEM, the vendor, the AOSP or the Magisk modules are displayed. It requires root. Therefore, this menu item will not be\nlisted if root permission is unavailable to App Manager.</string>
    <string name="pages$main-page$running-apps">This menu item opens a new page where a list of running applications or processes are displayed. It also displays the\ncurrent memory and cache (if available) usage. If root or ADB is not available to App Manager, it only displays itself\nin the recent versions of Android. The running applications or processes can also be force-stopped or killed within the\nresultant page. Logs for each process ID (PID) can also be viewed in the \\hyperref[subsubsec:log-viewer]{log viewer}.\nIn addition, it is also possible to carry out batch operations either by clicking on the icon or by long-clicking on an\nitem. Normal click on any items opens a dialog where a more detailed information is displayed.</string>
    <string name="pages$main-page$profiles">This menu item opens the \\hyperref[sec:profiles-page]{profiles page}. Profiles are a way to configure regularly used\ntasks. They can also be invoked via shortcuts.</string>
    <string name="pages$main-page$log-viewer">This menu item opens the log viewer page which can display and manage logs using the \\texttt{logcat} command. By\ndefault, this page can only display the activities of App Manager. However, it can display logs from all the\nprocesses if \\texttt{android.permission.READ\\_LOGS} is granted. This permission granted automatically if the current\n\\hyperref[subsec:mode-of-operation]{mode of operation} is either root or ADB\\\@.</string>
    <string name="pages$main-page$apk-updater">If the app \\href{https://github.com/rumboalla/apkupdater}{APK Updater} is installed in the system, it can be opened\ndirectly via this menu item. The option remains hidden if the app is not present in the system.</string>
    <string name="pages$main-page$termux">If the app \\href{https://github.com/termux/termux-app}{Termux} is installed in the system, the running session (or a\nnew session) can be opened directly via this menu item. The option remains hidden if the app is not present in the\nsystem.</string>

    <string name="pages$app-details-page$colour-codes">List of background colours used in this page, and their meaning:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\colorbox{AMRed}{\\textcolor{black}{Red (day)}} / \\colorbox{AMDarkRed}{\\textcolor{white}{dark red (night)}}\n    -- Denotes any app ops or permissions having the dangerous flag, or any components blocked within App Manager\n\n    \\item \\colorbox{AMLightRed}{\\textcolor{black}{Light red (day)}} / \\colorbox{AMVeryDarkRed}{\\textcolor{white}{very\n    dark red (night)}} -- Denotes the components disabled outside of App Manager\n\n    \\begin{tip}{Note}\n        A component marked as disabled does not always mean that it is disabled by the user: It could also be disabled\n        by the system or marked as disabled in its manifest. The components of a disabled application are also\n        considered disabled by the system (and App Manager).\n    \\end{tip}\n\n    \\item \\colorbox{AMVividOrange}{\\textcolor{black}{Vivid orange (day)}} / \\colorbox{AMVeryDarkOrange}{\n        \\textcolor{white}{very dark orange (night)}} -- Denotes the tracker components\n\n    \\item \\colorbox{AMSoftMagenta}{\\textcolor{black}{Soft magenta (day)}} / \\colorbox{AMVeryDarkViolet}{\n        \\textcolor{white}{very dark violet (night)}} -- Denotes the running services.\n\\end{itemize}</string>
    <string name="pages$app-details-page$app-info-tab">\\textbf{App Info} tab contains general information about an application. It also lists many actions that can be\nperformed within this tab.</string>
    <string name="pages$app-details-page$app-info-general-information">The list below is in the same order as listed in the App Info tab.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{App Icon.} The application icon. If an app doesn\'t have an icon, the system default icon is displayed.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{App Label.} The application label or application name.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Version.} Application version is divided into two parts. The first part is called \\textit{version\n    name}, the format of this part varies but it often consists of multiple integers separated by dots. The second part\n    is called \\textit{version code} and it is closed under first brackets. Version code is an integer which is usually\n    used to differentiate between app versions (as version name can often be unreadable by a machine). In general, new\n    version of an app has higher version code than the old ones. For instance, if \\texttt{123} and \\texttt{125} are two\n    version codes of an app, we can say that the latter is more updated than the former because the version code of the\n    latter is higher. For applications that depend on platforms (mobile, tabs, desktops, etc.), these version numbers\n    can be misleading as they use prefixes for each platform.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Tags.} (Also known as tag clouds) Tags include the basic, concise and most useful info of an app.\n    Tags contain \\textit{tracker info} (i.e.\\ number of tracker components), \\textit{app type} (user app or system app\n    and whether the app is an updated version of the system app or if the app is installed systemless-ly using Magisk),\n    \\textit{running} (i.e. one or more services of the app is running in the background), \\textit{split APK info} (i.e.\n    \\ number of splits), \\textit{debuggable} (the app is a debug version), \\textit{test only} (the app is a test only\n    app), \\textit{large heap} (the app has requested a large heap size), \\textit{stopped} (the app is force stopped),\n    \\textit{disabled} (the app is disabled), \\textit{KeyStore} (the app has items in the Android KeyStore),\n    \\textit{no code} (the app doesn\'t have any code associated with it), \\hyperref[sec:terminologies]{\\textit{SSAID}},\n    \\textit{netpolicy} (network policy such as background data usage), and \\textit{battery optimization}.\n    The importance of including \\textit{test only} and \\textit{debuggable} is that app with these properties can do\n    additional tasks or these apps can be \\texttt{run-as} without root which can cause potential security problems\n    if these apps store any private information.\n    \\textit{Large heap} denotes that the app will be allocated a higher amount of memory (RAM) if needed.\n    While this may not be harmful for most cases, any suspicious apps requesting large heap should be taken seriously.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Horizontal Action Panel.} This is an action panel containing various actions regarding the app. See\n    ยง\\ref{subsubsec:horizontal-action-panel} for a complete list of actions available here.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Paths \\&amp; Directories.} Contains various information regarding application paths including \\textit{app\n    directory} (where the APK files are stored), \\textit{data directories} (internal, device protected and externals),\n    \\textit{split APK directories} (along with the split names), and \\textit{native JNI library} (if present). JNI\n    libraries are used to invoke native codes usually written in C/C++. Use of native library can make the app run\n    faster or help an app use third-party libraries written using languages other than Java like in most games. You can\n    also open these directories using your favourite file managers (provided they support it and have necessary\n    permissions) by clicking on the launch icon on the right-hand side of each item.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Data Usage Since Last Boot.} A rather self explanatory option. But beware that due to some issues, the\n    results might often be misleading and simply wrong. This part remains hidden if \\textit{Usage Access} permission is\n    not granted in newer devices.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Storage \\&amp; Cache.} Displays information regarding the size of the app (APK files), data and cache. In\n    older devices, size of external data, cache, media and OBB folders are also displayed.

There are two (one in old devices) values:\n        \\textit{Max} denotes the target SDK and \\textit{Min} denotes the minimum SDK (the latter is not available in old\n        devices). It is best practice to use apps with maximum SDK that the platform currently supports.

There\'s also a\n        launch button on the right-hand side which can be used to launch this activity.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\\end{itemize}</string>
    <string name="pages$app-details-page$horizontal-action-panel">Horizontal Action Panel, as described in the previous section, consists of various app-related actions, such as--\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Launch.} Application that has a launcher \\hyperref[subsubsec:activities]{activities} can be launched\n    using this button.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Disable.} Disable an app. This button is not displayed for already disabled apps or to users who do\n    not have root or \\hyperref[sec:adb-over-tcp]{ADB}. If you disable an app, the app will not be displayed in your\n    Launcher app. Shortcuts for the app will also be removed. If you disable a user app, you can only enable them via\n    App Manager or any other tool that supports it.

However, this is not always true.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Clear Data.} Clear data from an app. This includes any information stored in the internal and often\n    the external directories, including accounts (if set by the app), cache, etc. Clearing data from App Manager, for\n    example, removes all the rules (the blocking is not removed though) saved within the app. Which is why you should\n    always take backups of your rules. This button is not displayed to users who do not have root or ADB\\\@.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Clear Cache.} Clear app cache only. There is not any Android-way to clear app cache. Therefore, it\n    needs root permission to clear cache from the app\'s internal storage.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Install.} Install an APK opened using any third-party app. This button is only displayed for an\n    external APK that hasn\'t been installed.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{What\'s New.} This button is displayed for an APK that has higher version code than the installed one.\n    Clicking on this button displays a dialog consisting of differences in a version control manner.

    <string name="pages$app-details-page$component-tabs">\\textbf{Activities}, \\textbf{Services}, \\textbf{Receivers} (originally \\textit{broadcast receivers}) and\n\\textbf{Providers} (originally \\textit{Content Providers}) are together called the application components. This is\nbecause they share similar features in many ways. For example, they all have a \\textit{name} and a \\textit{label}.\nApplication components are the building blocks of any application, and most of these have to declared in the application\nmanifest. Application manifest is a file where application specific metadata are stored. The Android operating system\nlearns what to do with an app by reading the metadata. Colours used in these tabs are explained in\nยง\\ref{subsec:app-details-colour-codes}. You also have the ability to sort the list of components to display blocked or\ntracker components on top of the list using the \\textbf{Sort} option in the overflow menu.</string>
    <string name="pages$app-details-page$activities">\\textbf{Activities} are windows or pages that you can browse (for instance \\textit{Main page} and \\textit{App Details\npage} are two separate activities). In other words, an activity is a user interface (UI) component. Each activity can\nhave multiple UI components known as \\textit{widgets} or \\textit{fragments}, and similarly, each of these latter\ncomponents can have multiple of them nested or on top of each other. But an activity is the \\textit{master} component:\nThere cannot be two nested activities. An application author can also choose to open external files within an activity\nusing a method called \\textit{intent filters}. When you try to open a file using your file manager, either your file\nmanager or system scans for intent filters to decide which activities can open that particular file and offers you to\nopen the file with these activities (therefore, it is nothing to do with the application itself). There are other intent\nfilters as well.\n\nActivities which are \\textit{exportable} can be usually opened by any third-party apps (some activities require\npermissions, if that is the case, only an app having those permissions can open them). In the \\textit{Activities} tab,\nthe name of the activity (on top of each list item) is actually a button. It is enabled for the \\textit{exportable}\nactivities and disabled for others (root users can open any activities). You can click on the button to open the\nactivity directly in App Manager. You can also open the Interceptor page by long clicking on an activity. Currently, it\nonly works for \\textit{exportable} activities.\n\n\\begin{warning}{Notice}\n    If you are not able to open any activity, chances are it has certain dependencies which are not met, e.g.\\ you\n    cannot open  \\textit{App Details Activity} because it requires that you at least supply a package name. These\n    dependencies cannot always be inferred programmatically. Therefore, you cannot open them using App Manager.\n\\end{warning}\n\nYou can also create shortcut for these \\textit{exportable} activities (using the dedicated button), and if you want, you\ncan edit the shortcut as well using the \\textit{Edit Shortcut} button.\n\n\\begin{danger}{Caution}\n    If you uninstall App Manager, all shortcuts created by App Manager will be lost.\n\\end{danger}</string>
    <string name="pages$app-details-page$servcies">Unlike \\hyperref[subsubsec:activities]{activities} which users can see, \\textbf{Services} handle background tasks. If\nyou\'re, for example, downloading a video from the internet using your phone\'s Internet browser, the Internet browser is\nusing a foreground service to download the content.\n\nWhen you close an activity, it usually gets destroyed immediately (depending on many factors such as how much free\nmemory your phone has). But services can be run for indefinite periods if desired. If more services are running in\nbackground, your phone will get slower due to shortage of memory and/or processing power, and your phone\'s battery can\nbe drained more quickly. Newer Android versions have a battery optimisation feature enabled by default for all apps.\nWith this feature enabled, the system can randomly terminate any service.\n\nBy the way, both activities and services are run in the same \\href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7597742}{looper}\ncalled the main looper, which means the services are not really run in the background. It\'s the application authors job\nto ensure that. How do application communicate with services\? They use\n\\hyperref[subsubsec:app-details-receivers]{broadcast receivers}.</string>
    <string name="pages$app-details-page$receivers">\\textbf{Receivers} (also called \\textit{broadcast receivers}) can be used to trigger execution of certain tasks for\ncertain events. These components are called broadcast receivers because they are executed as soon as a broadcast message\nis received. These broadcast messages are sent using a method called intent. Intent is a special feature for Android\nwhich can be used to open applications, activities, services and send broadcast messages. Therefore, like\n\\hyperref[subsubsec:activities]{activities}, broadcast receivers use intent filters to receive only the desired\nbroadcast message(s). Broadcast messages can be sent by either system or the app itself. When a broadcast message is\nsent, the corresponding receivers are awakened by the system so that they can execute tasks. For example, if you have\nlow memory, your phone may freeze or experience lags for a moment after you enable mobile data or connect to the Wifi.\nEver wondered why\? This is because broadcast receivers that can receive `android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY\\_CHANGE` are\nawakened by the system as soon as you enable data connection. Since many apps use this intent filter, all of these apps\nare awakened almost immediately by the system which causes the freeze or lags. That being said, receivers can be used\nfor inter-process communication (IPC), i.e., it helps you communicate between different apps (provided you have the\nnecessary permissions) or even different components of a single app.</string>
    <string name="pages$app-details-page$providers">\\textbf{Providers} (also called \\textit{content providers}) are used for data management. For example, when you save an\napk file or export rules in App Manager, it uses a content provider called `androidx.core.content.FileProvider` to save\nthe APK or export the rules. There are other content providers or even custom ones to manage various content-related\ntasks such as database management, tracking, searching, etc. Each content provider has a field called \\textit{Authority}\nwhich is unique to that particular app in the entire Android eco-system just like the package name.</string>

If you do not have \\hyperref[subsubsec:instant-component-blocking]{Instant Component Blocking}\nenabled or haven\'t applied blocking for the app before, you have to apply the changes using the \\textbf{Apply rules}\noption in three-dots menu.

In Android\ncommunication between apps or processes which do not have the same identity (known as \\textit{shared id}) often require\npermission(s). These permissions are managed by the permission controller. Some permissions are considered\n\\textit{normal} permissions which are granted automatically if they appear in the application manifest, but\n\\textit{dangerous} and \\textit{development} permissions require confirmation from the user.

    <string name="pages$interceptor-page$intro">Interceptor can be used to intercept communication between apps using \\texttt{Intent}. It works as a man-in-the-middle\nbetween the source and the destination apps. It offers a feature-complete user interface for editing \\texttt{Intent}s.\n\n\\begin{tip}{Info}\n    Development of interceptor is still in progress. It can only intercept activities for now.\n\\end{tip}\n\n\\begin{warning}{Warning}\n    Interceptor only works for \\textit{implicit} intents where the \\hyperref[subsec:faq:what-are-app-components]{app\n    component} isn\'t specified.\n\\end{warning}\n\n\\begin{amseealso}\n    \\item \\href{https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common}{Common Intents}\n    \\item \\href{https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters}{Intents and Intent Filters}\n\\end{amseealso}</string>
    <string name="pages$interceptor-page$intent-filters">Intent filters are used by the apps to specify which tasks they are able to perform or which tasks they are going to\nperform using other apps. For example, when you\'re opening a PDF file using a file manager, the file manager will try\nto find which apps to open the PDF with. To find the right applications, the file manager will create an Intent with\nfilters such as MIME type and ask the system to retrieve the matched applications that is able to open this filter.\nThe system will search through the Manifest of the installed applications to match the filter and list the app\ncomponents that are able to open this filter (in our case the PDF). At this, either the file manager will open the\ndesired app component itself or use a system provided option to open it. If multiple app components are able to open it\nand no default is set, you may get a prompt where you have to choose the right app component.</string>
    <string name="pages$interceptor-page$action">Action specifies the generic action to perform such as \\texttt{android.intent.action.VIEW}. Applications often declare\nthe relevant actions in the Manifest file to catch the desired Intents. The action is particularly useful for broadcast\nIntent where it plays a vital rule. In other cases, it works as an initial way to filter out relevant app components.\nGeneric actions such as \\texttt{android.intent.action.VIEW} and \\texttt{android.intent.action.SEND} are widely used by\napps. So, setting this alone may match many app components.</string>
    <string name="pages$interceptor-page$data">Data is originally known as URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) defined in\n\\href{http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2396.html}{RFC 2396}. It can be web links, file location, or a special feature called\n\\textit{content}. Contents are an Android feature managed by the \\hyperref[appdetails:providers]{content providers}.\nData are often associated with a \\hyperref[subsubsec:mime-type]{MIME type}.\n\nExamples:</string>
    <string name="pages$interceptor-page$mime-type">MIME type of the \\hyperref[subsubsec:data]{data}. For example, if the data field is set to\n\\texttt{file:///sdcard/AppManager.apk}, the associated MIME type can be \\texttt{application/vnd.android.package-archive}.</string>
    <string name="pages$interceptor-page$categories">This is similar to \\hyperref[subsubsec:action]{action} in the sense that it is also used by the system to filter app\ncomponents. This has no further benefits. Unlike \\textit{action}, there can be more than one category. Clicking on the\n\\textit{plus} button next to the title allows adding more categories.</string>
    <string name="pages$interceptor-page$flags">Flags are useful in determining how system should behave during the launch or after the launch of an activity. An\naverage user should avoid this as it requires some technical background. The \\textit{plus} button next to the title can\nbe used to add one or more flags.</string>
    <string name="pages$interceptor-page$extras">Extras are the key-value pairs used for supplying additional information to the destination component. You can add\nextras using the \\textit{plus} button next to the title.</string>
    <string name="pages$interceptor-page$uri">Represents the entire Intent as a URI (e.g. \\texttt{intent://\\dots}). Some data cannot be converted to string, and as a\nresult, they might not appear here.</string>
    <string name="pages$interceptor-page$matching-activities">List all the activity components that matches the Intent. This is internally determined by the system (rather than AM).\nThe launch button next to each component can be used to launch them directly from AM\\\@.</string>
    <string name="pages$interceptor-page$reset-to-default">Reset the Intent to its initial state. This may not always work as expected.</string>
    <string name="pages$interceptor-page$send-edited-intent">Resend the edited Intent to the destination app. This may open a list of apps where you have to select the desired app.\nThe result received from the target app will be sent to the source app. As a result the source app will not know if\nthere was a man-in-the-middle.</string>

    <string name="faq$app-components$$how-to-unblock-title">How to unblock the tracker components blocked using 1-Click Ops or Batch Ops\?</string>
    <string name="faq$app-components$what-are-app-components">Activities, services, broadcast receivers (also known as receivers) and content providers (also known as providers) are\njointly called app components. More technically, they all inherit the\n\\href{https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ComponentInfo}{ComponentInfo} class.</string>
    <string name="faq$app-components$limitations">AM blocks application components (or tracker components) using a method called\n\\href{https://carteryagemann.com/pages/android-intent-firewall.html}{Intent Firewall (IFW)}, it is very superior to\nother methods such as \\textit{pm} (PackageManager), \\href{https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku}{Shizuku} or any other\nmethod that uses the package manager to enable or disable the components. If a component is disabled by the latter\nmethods, the app itself can detect that the component is being blocked and can re-enable it as it has full access to its\nown components. (Many deceptive apps actually exploit this in order to keep the tracker components unblocked.) On the\nother hand, IFW is a true firewall and the app cannot detect if the blocking is present. It also cannot re-enable it by\nany means. AM uses the term \\textit{block} rather than \\textit{disable} for this reason.\n\nEven IFW has some limitations which are primarily applicable for the system apps:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The app in question is whitelisted by the system i.e.\\ the system cannot function properly without these apps\n    and may cause random crashes. These apps include but not limited to Android System, System UI, Phone Services. They\n    will run even if you disable them or block their components via IFW\\\@.\n\n    \\item Another system app or system process is calling a specific component of the app in question via interprocess\n    communication (IPC). In this case, the component will be activated regardless of its presence in the IFW rules or\n    even if the entire app is disabled. If you have such system apps, the only way to prevent them from running is to\n    get rid of them.\n\\end{itemize}</string>
    <string name="faq$app-components$detect-by-related-apps">It is because of the blocking method I\'m using. This method is called\n\\href{https://carteryagemann.com/pages/android-intent-firewall.html}{Intent Firewall (IFW)} and is compatible with\n\\href{https://github.com/tuyafeng/Watt}{Watt} and \\href{https://github.com/lihenggui/blocker}{Blocker}.\n\\href{https://www.myandroidtools.com}{MyAndroidTool (MAT)} supports IFW, but it uses a different format. Therefore,\nWatt can detect blocked components by default but Blocker can only detect them if you enable IFW in its settings page.\nMAT cannot detect AM\'s blocking rules since the format is different. AM cannot detect MAT\'s rules if IFW is enabled in\nMAT. In that case, you can still import them from the \\hyperref[sec:settings-page]{settings page}. MAT has an export\noption, but it\'s not supported due to its non-free nature.</string>
    <string name="faq$app-components$other-tools-retained-in-am">\\textbf{No.} But components blocked by the Android System or any other tools are displayed in the\n\\hyperref[sec:app-details-page]{App Details page} (within the component tabs). In v2.5.12 and onwards, you can import\nthese rules in \\hyperref[par:import-existing-rules]{Settings}. But since there is no way to distinguish between\ncomponents blocked by third-party apps and components blocked by the System, you should be very careful when choosing\napp.</string>
    <string name="faq$app-components$also-blocked-by-other-tools">AM blocks the components again using\n\\href{https://carteryagemann.com/pages/android-intent-firewall.html}{Intent Firewall (IFW)}. They are not unblocked (if\nblocked using \\textit{pm} or \\href{https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku}{Shizuku} method) and blocked again. But if you\nunblock a component in the \\hyperref[sec:app-details-page]{App Details page}, it will be reverted back to default state\nโ- blocked or unblocked as described in the corresponding app manifest โ- using both IFW and \\textit{pm} method.\nHowever, components blocked by \\href{https://www.myandroidtools.com}{MyAndroidTools (MAT)} with IFW method will not be\nunblocked by AM. To solve this issue, you can first import the corresponding configuration to AM in\n\\hyperref[par:import-existing-rules]{Settings} in which case MAT\'s configurations will be removed. But this option is\nonly available from v2.5.12.</string>
    <string name="faq$app-components$what-is-component-blocking">When you block a component in the \\hyperref[sec:app-details-page]{App Details page}, the blocking is not applied by\ndefault. It is only applied when you apply blocking using the \\textit{Apply rules} option in the top-right menu. If you\nenable \\hyperref[subsubsec:instant-component-blocking]{instant component blocking}, blocking will be applied as soon as you block a component. If you choose to\nblock tracker components, however, blocking is applied automatically regardless of this setting. You can also remove\nblocking for an app by simply clicking on \\textit{Remove rules} in the same menu in the \\textbf{App Details page}. Since\nthe default behaviour gives you more control over apps, it is better to keep \\textit{instant component blocking} option\ndisabled.</string>
    <string name="faq$app-components$tracker-classes-versus-tracker-components">All app components are classes but not all classes are components. In fact, only a few of the classes are components.\nThat being said, \\hyperref[sec:scanner-page]{scanner page} displays a list of trackers along with the number of classes,\nnot just the components. In all other pages, trackers and tracker components are used synonymously to denote tracker\ncomponents, i.e.\\ blocking tracker means blocking tracker components, not tracker classes.\n\n\\begin{tip}{Info}\n    Tracker classes cannot be blocked. They can only be removed by editing the app itself.\n\\end{tip}</string>
    <string name="faq$app-components$how-to-unblock">Some apps may misbehave due to their dependency to tracker components blocked by AM. From v2.5.12, there is an option\nto unblock tracker components in the \\hyperref[sec:1-click-ops-page]{1-Click Ops page}. However, in previous versions,\nthere is no such options. To unblock these tracker components, first go to the \\hyperref[sec:app-details-page]{App\nDetails page} of the misbehaving app. Then, switching to the \\textit{Activities} tab, click on the \\textit{Remove rules}\noptions in the top-right menu. All the blocking rules related to the components of the app will be removed immediately.\nAlternatively, if you have found the component that is causing the issue, you can unblock the component by clicking on\nthe \\textit{unblock} button next to the component name. If you have enabled\n\\hyperref[subsubsec:instant-component-blocking]{instant component blocking} in Settings, disable it first as\n\\textit{Remove rules} option will not be visible when it is enabled.\n\nIf you have \\textbf{Google Play Services} (\\texttt{com.google.android.gms}) installed, unblocking the following\n\\hyperref[subsubsec:details:servcies]{services} may fix certain crashes:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Ad Request Broker Service \\small{\\texttt{.ads.AdRequestBrokerService}}\n    \\item Cache Broker Service \\small{\\texttt{.ads.cache.CacheBrokerService}}\n    \\item Gservices Value Broker Service \\small{\\texttt{.ads.GservicesValueBrokerService}}\n    \\item Advertising Id Notification Service \\small{\\texttt{.ads.identifier.service.AdvertisingIdNotificationService}}\n    \\item Advertising Id Service \\small{\\texttt{.ads.identifier.service.AdvertisingIdService}}\n\\end{enumerate}</string>

    <string name="faq$aot$restart">Unfortunately, yes. However, as of v2.5.13, you don\'t need to keep AoT enabled all the time as it now uses a\nserver-client mechanism to interact with the system, but you do have to keep the \\textbf{Developer options} as well as\n\\textbf{USB debugging} enabled. To do that, enable \\hyperref[sec:adb-over-tcp]{ADB over TCP} and open App Manager. You\nshould see \\textit{working on ADB mode} toast message in the bottom. If you see it, you can safely stop the server. For\nLineage OS or its derivative OS, you can toggle AoT without any PC or Mac by simply toggling the \\textbf{ADB over\nnetwork} option located just below the \\textbf{USB debugging}, but the server can\'t be stopped for the latter case.</string>

    <string name="faq$aot$feature-adb">Most of the features supported by ADB mode are enabled by default once ADB support is detected by AM.

    <string name="faq$misc$i-dont-use-root-adb">Yes. AM cannot modify any system settings without root or ADB over TCP\\\@.</string>
    <string name="faq$misc$why-internet-permission">AM uses the INTERNET permission for the following reasons:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{To provide ADB over TCP support for the non-root users.} ADB over TCP is a custom network protocol\n    that usually runs on port \\texttt{5555}. Therefore, to connect to this port via localhost, AM needs this permission.\n    \\item \\textbf{To execute privileged code both on root and ADB mode.} AM, being a user app, cannot execute privileged\n    code nor can it access any hidden APIs. Consequently, AM runs a server in the privileged environment using\n    \\texttt{app\\_process} at port \\texttt{60001} and on the user side, AM connects to this server and execute privileged\n    code remotely from the app. Now, there are alternative ways to communicate with a remote service. Currently, they\n    are under consideration.\n\\end{enumerate}</string>
    <string name="faq$misc$how-tracker-updated">Trackers and libraries are updated manually before making a new release.</string>
    <string name="faq$misc$shizuku">App Manager\'s use of hidden API and privileged code execution is now much more complex and cannot be integrated with\nother third party apps such as \\href{https://shizuku.rikka.app}{Shizuku}. Here are some reasons for not considering\nShizuku (which now has Apache 2.0 license) for App Manager:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Shizuku was initially non-free which led me to use a similar approach for App Manager to support both root\n    and ADB\n    \\item App Manager already supports both ADB and root which in some cases is more capable than Shizuku\n    \\item Relying on a third-party app for the major functionalities is not a good design choice\n    \\item Integration of Shizuku will increase the complexity of App Manager.\n\\end{enumerate}</string>
    <string name="faq$misc$bloatware">Bloatware are the unnecessary apps supplied by the vendor or OEM and are usually system apps. These apps are often used\nto track users and collect user data which they might sell for profits. System apps do not need to request any\npermission in order to access device info, contacts and messaging data, and other usage info such as your phone usage\nhabits and everything you store on your shared storage(s).\n\nThe bloatware may also include Google apps (such as Google Play Services, Google Play Store, Gmail, Google, Messages,\nDialer, Contacts), Facebook apps (the Facebook app consists of four or five apps), Facebook Messenger, Instagram,\nTwitter and many other apps which can also track users and/or collect user data without consent given that they all are\nsystem apps. You can disable a few permissions from the Android settings but be aware that Android settings hides almost\nevery permission any security specialist would call potentially \\emph{dangerous}.\n\nIf the bloatware were user apps, you could easily uninstall them either from Android settings or AM. Uninstalling system\napps is not possible without root permission. You can also uninstall system apps using ADB, but it may not work for all\napps. AM can uninstall system apps with root or ADB (the latter with certain limitations, of course), but these methods\ncannot \\emph{remove} the system apps completely as they are located in the \\emph{system} partition which is a read-only\npartition. If you have root, you can remount this partition to manually \\emph{purge} these apps but this will break Over\nthe Air (OTA) updates since data in the system partition has been modified. There are two kind of updates, delta\n(small-size, consisting of only the changes between two versions) and full updates. You can still apply full updates,\nbut the bloatware will be installed again, and consequently, you have to delete them all over again. Besides, not all\nvendors provide full updates.\n\nAnother solution is to disable these apps either from Android settings (no-root) or AM, but certain services can still\nrun in the background as they can be started by other system apps using Inter-process Communication (IPC). One possible\nsolution is to disable all bloatware until the service has finally stopped (after a restart). However, due to heavy\nmodifications of the Android frameworks by the vendors, removing or disabling certain bloatware may cause the System UI\nto crash or even cause bootloop, thus, (soft) bricking your device. You may search the web or consult the fellow users\nto find out more about how to debloat your device.\n\nFrom v2.5.19, AM has a new feature called \\hyperref[sec:profile-page]{profiles}. The\n\\hyperref[sec:profiles-page]{profiles page} has an option to create new profiles from one of the presets. The presets\nconsist of debloating profiles which can be used as a starting point to monitor, disable, and remove the bloatware from\na proprietary Android operating system.\n\n\\begin{warning}{Note}\n    In most cases, you cannot completely debloat your device. Therefore, it is recommended that you use a custom ROM\n    free from bloatware such as Graphene OS, Lineage OS or their derivatives.\n\\end{warning}</string>
